# Research on continuous path planning of intelligent warehousing multi-robot



## Search based on Pre-judgment Conflict

Search based on Pre-judgment Conflicts (SPC) is a near real-time path planning algorithm that plans a path for the robot at each moment. The map environment changes in real time, once the robot path is successfully planned, the 2D raster map will record the position it traveled and the corresponding moment. 

### Execution
Run:
```
cd /spc
python main.py
```
